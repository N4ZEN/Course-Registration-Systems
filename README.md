<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Course Registration System complete with GUI

****************
In 2019, where few manual processes remain yet to be automated, the process of registering and paying for courses in most universities
is still done manually. The university has to receive the proof of fee payment and then register students one by one.
Hence, like all other computer programs, this course registration system is designed and developed to bring about productivity,
efficiency, and ease of access for all the parties involved. Implementation of this system would enable universities to exercise 
greater control over their administrative services. It will also allow students to not only view all the available courses but also to 
register and do the fee payment verification process all in one place.
The pharmacy system is designed in such a way that it revolves around two categories of users, which are admin and students. 
They both have different access rights to the system with their own functionalities.
This system provides a number of functionalities pertaining to course registration for the students as well as admin staff. 
Registration for the course is possible only if the student has paid the fees, i.e. has a valid fee receipt number. 
Students can login, view, register, drop courses, whereas the admin can login, view the number of students registered 
for their course, add a new course they are planning to start, drop a course they are planning to discontinue etc.
This course Registration System features OOP concepts such as, inheritance, abstraction polymorphism and interfaces. 
It also uses classes, objects, and method, and features exception handing, various packages and frames for the user interface.
